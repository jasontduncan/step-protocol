# Phase 5 – Step 5.1: Validate the meta-node against the protocol
status: done
started: 2025-11-25T20:33:50Z
completed: 2025-11-25T20:34:12Z

## Scope
Run `worktree audit` against `docs/work/` to ensure the meta-node complies with the protocol (PLAN/STATE/logs, step consistency, and allowed files).

## Plan
- [x] Execute the audit command to validate every discovered WorkNode (meta-node plus any siblings).
- [x] Review output for any violations and note whether `worktree audit` exits successfully.
- [x] Record outcomes showing the meta-node already follows the rules or highlight fixes if not.

## Notes
- 2025-11-25T20:34:00Z Ran `node dist/cli.js audit` so the CLI walker invoked `auditWorkNodes` against `docs/work/` and reported `[ok] /home/jason/dev/workTree/docs/work`.
- 2025-11-25T20:34:05Z Confirmed the audit command exited cleanly (exit code 0) after validating the meta-node and not discovering any extra nodes needing fixes.

## Outcomes
- The meta-node and any discovered WorkNodes pass the validator via `worktree audit`, demonstrating full compliance for Phase 5.
- The audit command emits `[ok]` per node and exits non-zero only when there are validation errors, making it suitable for CI gating.
