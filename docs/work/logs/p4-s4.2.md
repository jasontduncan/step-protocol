## Scope
Author a top-level README that explains WorkTree fundamentals, shows how to initialize/run/audit nodes, and shares recommended multi-node layouts.

## Plan
- [x] Describe the repository’s meta-node plus CLI capabilities for initialization, work execution, and auditing.
- [x] Document the `worktree init`, `run`, and `audit` commands with their typical usage patterns.
- [x] Outline a recommended project layout for combining a meta-node with leaf nodes.

## Notes
- 2025-11-25T20:31:30Z Drafted `README.md` with sections covering the meta-node, CLI entry points, and example usage of `init`, `run`, and `audit`.
- 2025-11-25T20:32:10Z Added recommendations for storing leaf nodes in subdirectories while leaving the meta-node to track cross-node plans.
- 2025-11-25T20:33:12Z Confirmed the README references `docs/work/WORK_PROTOCOL.md` and refreshed the repository tree to show the new doc.
- 2025-11-25T20:33:25Z Ran `npm run build` after adding README.md to ensure the TypeScript compile step still succeeds.

## Outcomes
- A README now summarizes how to bootstrap nodes, execute steps, and audit for protocol compliance.
- Developers see a recommended layout: central meta-node plus leaf nodes created via `worktree init` in sibling directories.
- The new documentation gives quick reference links back to `docs/work/WORK_PROTOCOL.md` for invariant details.
