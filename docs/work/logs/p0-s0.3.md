# Phase 0 – Step 0.3: Implement execution protocol helpers
status: done
started: 2025-11-25T19:50:43Z
completed: 2025-11-25T19:53:10Z

## Scope
Implement helpers that parse PLAN.md/STATE.md, determine the next actionable step, manage log files, and persist status transitions safely.

## Plan
- [x] Parse PLAN.md into structured step objects.
- [x] Parse STATE.md into a typed table model.
- [x] Identify the next actionable step according to the protocol and expose it for callers.
- [x] Create/update log files for steps and persist STATE.md changes when statuses move.

## Notes
- 2025-11-25T19:53:03Z Added markdown parsers, identifier comparison helpers, log path utilities, and loader helpers so WorkNodes now yield structured `WorkPlan`/`WorkState` objects.
- 2025-11-25T19:53:03Z Implemented `canonicalLogPaths`, `createStepLog`, `updateLogHeader`, `updateStateEntry`, and `writeState` to cover log lifecycle work.
- 2025-11-25T19:53:03Z Ran `npm run build` to confirm the new helpers compile under the NodeNext configuration.
- 2025-11-25T19:53:10Z Marked Step 0.3 complete in STATE.md and finalized this log.

## Outcomes
- Parsing helpers (`parsePlan`/`parseState` and sync variants) map PLAN.md/STATE.md into typed `WorkPlan`/`WorkState` instances.
- `findNextActionableStep` (with the comparator) enforces the protocol’s deterministic selection ordering.
- Log/state helpers (`canonicalLogPaths`, `createStepLog`, `updateLogHeader`, `updateStateEntry`, `writeState`) make it straightforward to manage logs and persist status transitions.
