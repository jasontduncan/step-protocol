## Scope
Tighten §3 (Node Bootstrap) so the protocol explicitly forbids `worktree init` from running the general PLAN/STATE validator during bootstrap, and describe the intended control flow (PLAN-only -> STATE creation -> exit) as the authoritative source-of-truth for the initial state.

## Plan
- [x] Clearly state in §3 that bootstrap is the sole source of PLAN/STATE consistency checks and that `worktree init` must skip the general validator when STATE.md is missing.
- [x] Add an “Implementation Notes” subsection under §3 that outlines the expected `worktree init` flow (detect PLAN-only, generate STATE, stop) without changing existing rules.
- [x] Confirm the wording makes the bootstrap behavior unambiguous for future implementers.

## Notes
- 2025-11-25T23:32:00Z Added prose to §3 stating that bootstrap is the authoritative path and that `worktree init` must skip the general validator whenever STATE.md is absent.
- 2025-11-25T23:40:00Z Added the Implementation Notes subsection to capture the intended detection -> state generation -> exit flow for future maintainers.

## Outcomes
- The protocol now explicitly forbids running the general PLAN–STATE validator during Node Bootstrap and documents the bootstrap steps as the source of truth.
- Implementation Notes under §3 describe how `worktree init` should detect the PLAN-only case, derive STATE.md, and stop before invoking other validators.
