## Scope
Search the filesystem for WorkNodes, understand their parent/child nesting, and ensure loaders can open a node from a path.

## Plan
- [x] Recursively scan directories under the meta-node for any valid WorkNode layout.
- [x] Determine parent/child relationships for each discovered node so hierarchies are easy to reason about.
- [x] Expose loader helpers that open a WorkNode (layout + placeholder plan/state) once its directory is known.

## Notes
- 2025-11-25T19:48:10Z Added `discoverWorkNodes` to validate directories as WorkNodes while walking children, skipping build/log folders.
- 2025-11-25T19:48:18Z Introduced `buildWorkNodeRelations` plus `loadWorkNode`/`loadWorkNodeSync` to reason about ancestry and obtain schema placeholders for any root.
- 2025-11-25T19:48:29Z Ran `npm run build` to ensure the augmented module compiles with NodeNext and the newly exposed helpers.

## Outcomes
- `discoverWorkNodes` recursively detects every valid layout beneath the meta-node while honoring ignore patterns.
- `buildWorkNodeRelations` captures parent/child structure across normalized paths.
- `loadWorkNode`/`loadWorkNodeSync` now expose loader utilities so downstream steps can focus on parsing PLAN/STATE with a validated layout.
