# Phase 6 – Step 6.4: Fix starter PLAN template identifier

## Scope
Update the `worktree init` template so that the starter PLAN uses normalized identifiers (e.g., `Step 0.1` instead of `Step 0.0.1`), keeping STATE bootstrap generation aligned with that identifier format.

## Plan
- [x] Adjust `buildPlanMarkdown` so it emits the identifier that already exists on each `PlanStep` instead of prefixing the phase again.
- [x] Confirm default `DEFAULT_INIT_PLAN_STEPS` still describe `Step 0.1` and that the bootstrap STATE builder remains compatible.
- [x] Run `npm run build` to ensure the CLI compiles after the change.

## Notes
- 2025-11-26T00:11:40Z Adjusted `buildPlanMarkdown` to reuse the plan step’s existing identifier, avoiding the duplicated `phase.step` string that produced `Step 0.0.1`.
- 2025-11-26T00:13:05Z Confirmed `DEFAULT_INIT_PLAN_STEPS` still refer to `Step 0.1` and no additional bootstrap changes were needed.
- 2025-11-26T00:14:50Z Ran `npm run build` to ensure the CLI compiles with the new template.

## Outcomes
- `worktree init`’s starter PLAN now uses normalized identifiers (`Step 0.1`), keeping PLAN and STATE bootstrap expectations aligned.
- The template change is safe for default STATE generation because it still draws from `PlanStep.step`, which equals the actual identifier string.
- CLI compilation continues to succeed after this refactor.
