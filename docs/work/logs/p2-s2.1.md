# Phase 2 – Step 2.1: Implement CLI scaffolding (`worktree` command)
status: done
started: 2025-11-25T20:07:29Z
completed: 2025-11-25T20:07:46Z

## Scope
Create the initial `worktree` executable, define basic subcommands, and implement the `--help`/`--version` contract so future commands have a shared foundation.

## Plan
- [x] Add a CLI entry point that can be invoked via `worktree` and loads compiled code from `dist/`.
- [x] Implement the minimal command framework with `init`, `run`, `audit`, and `status` placeholders plus help/version handling.
- [x] Wire the package `bin` field so installing the package exposes the CLI.

## Notes
- 2025-11-25T20:07:35Z Added `src/cli.ts` with `main()` plus help/version handling and command placeholders referencing the worktree protocol documents.
- 2025-11-25T20:07:40Z Created the executable `bin/worktree.js` and configured `package.json`’s `bin.worktree` entry so installing this package exposes the CLI stub.
- 2025-11-25T20:07:44Z Ran `npm run build` to compile the CLI sources into `dist/cli.js`, making the stub executable via the compiled bundle.

## Outcomes
- The CLI now exposes a `main()` entry that prints help/version and acknowledges the four primary subcommands.
- The `bin/worktree.js` stub loads the compiled `dist/cli.js`, so running `worktree` executes the TypeScript-built CLI.
- The `package.json` `bin` field ties the executable to the package so future installs publish the `worktree` command automatically.
