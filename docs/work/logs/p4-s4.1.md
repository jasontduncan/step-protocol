## Scope
Create an `examples/hello-worknode/` directory that exemplifies a WorkNode, initialize it via `worktree init`, and author a minimal PLAN that demonstrates the protocol.

## Plan
- [x] Create `examples/hello-worknode/` and run `worktree init` there.
- [x] Craft a simple PLAN.md that showcases how a leaf WorkNode might document its steps.
- [x] Confirm the generated STATE/logs reflect the protocol (PLAN/STATE sync, logs directory present).

## Notes
- 2025-11-25T20:31:00Z Ran `node dist/cli.js init --target examples/hello-worknode` so the example WorkNode now has PLAN, STATE, and an empty `logs/` directory per the protocol.
- 2025-11-25T20:31:20Z Verified `examples/hello-worknode/PLAN.md` describes the default Step `0.1` and references `docs/work/WORK_PROTOCOL.md` as recommended.
- 2025-11-25T20:31:30Z Confirmed STATE.md lists the new step at `todo` and that `logs/` exists even though no log file yet.

## Outcomes
- `examples/hello-worknode/` now serves as a leaf WorkNode with a documented Plan and State that obeys the protocol.
- The meta CLI (`worktree`) can bootstrap additional nodes via `worktree init` without extra scripting.
